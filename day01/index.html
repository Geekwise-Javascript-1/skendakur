    <!--When you write javascript you need to have it inbetween script tags.
        Our name is a string.
        You can put it in double quotation marks or single quotation marks.
        Camel casing = using caps to delineate space between words.
        Always start with a lower case for first letter when camel casing.
        document.write will put it out on the screen.
        console.log will show up in the console tab when inspecting.
        strings = words
        Escaping a character, use a "/"
        boolean = a true or false situation
